Docker containers for Symfony development
=========================================

This repository provides a build script and Dockerfiles for setting up a complete Symfony development environment.

The goal is to allow this setup to be easily deployed to production by stripping off dev-specific Docker images.

This repository is still in early development. Feel free to contribute.
